# Notifications

Provides social network style notifications for your Meteor app.

>This is a [Meteor][meteor] package with part of it's code published as a companion NPM package made to work with React Native. This allows your Meteor and React Native projects that use this package to share code between them to give you a competitive advantage when bringing your mobile and web application to market.

## Supporting the Project
In the spirit of keeping this and all of the packages in the [Socialize][socialize] set alive, I ask that if you find this package useful, please donate to it's development.

## Meteor Installation

This package relies on the npm package `simpl-schema` so you will need to make sure it is installed as well.

```shell
$ meteor npm install --save simpl-schema
$ meteor add socialize:notifications
```

## React Native Installation

When using this package with React Native, the dependency tree ensures that `simpl-schema` is loaded so there's no need to install it as when using within Meteor.

```shell
$ npm install --save @socialize/notifications
```
> **Note**
>
>  When using with React Native, you'll need to connect to a server which hosts the server side Meteor code for your app using `Meteor.connect` as per the [@socialize/react-native-meteor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialize/react-native-meteor#example-usage) documentation.

## Basic Usage

Depending on the environment your code will be running in, you'll need to import the classes from the packages specific to that environment, either Meteor or React Native.
